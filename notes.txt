Can be downloaded as GEOJSON it seems. 

Problems:
Some vessels report different gear types, also over a short period.
    Some boats have the same name! Check the vessel ID, must be the same. How to link this to mmsi? cant really join on vessel name. 
    A bit inaccurate, COULD do some region filter, but two vessels with the same name could operate in the same area
    Use callsign.
And why does some ships show up in the fangstdata and not AIS, because it is filtered for north and south of 62!


Improvements:
Could filter out vessels under 15 minutes, as they are not required to use AIS
